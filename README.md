# RyanCortino.github.io

Source code for my personal developer profile hosted on Github Pages. I will use this website to showcase my experiences and skillsets related to software and game development. It is made using a combination of Ruby, Jekyll, HTML, and CSS.

This is my first time working specifically with Ruby and Jekyll, so this project will also act as a tutorial of sorts. I have experience working both with frontends and backends (specifically Joomla), which I expect to come in very handy.
